#note Maybe MU / HM? It may have crossed my mind, but I don't think I considered it. Though it does give back a nice spot for mishu, I can draw into good column H plays after it. (H)UM is another idea along those lines.

#note Didn't see INJURE, not sure I like it though. He just scores on column A afterward.

#note I played this pretty quickly, not generating the three other available bingos, which all score 3 less. OvERmILK is promising, as it is the only one of the 4 to put a vowel at 8A.

#note I didn't see COFT/CROFT soon enough. So, can you do better than losing here? Mostly on the back of Quackle, I have a tying sequence (in which I don't know if all the plays are optimal), which I will post at the end of the game (error correction would be appreciated, if in fact necessary!) ETA 12/20/19: A comment from Mack seems to show that I can guarantee a win.
