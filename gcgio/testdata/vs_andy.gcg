#note -3.5 seems like 7H AURA or 7I UTA are good. i did consider keeping the Z, but i couldn't think of a good play. but AIRTU kind of sucks, too.

#note i should not try to play defense when i'm down. how many times do i have to tell myself that? ABEL is better than ABE too. MOO is definitely better than my move. DOABLE is best which i just missed. (-6.5)

#note damn vatu. DAMN IT. stupid game. i missed MOOLA, N9 ERA seems to be good there because it also sets up DELFS or something like that that i may need. DAN's leave isn't strong enough. -7
