#note Didn't know what to do here, but I'm fairly certain none of the equity plays are correct after an exchange 1. This does okay in a sim, 80% as opposed to 84% for the best equity plays, so I'm alright with this for the defensive value. If you see something I missed let me know.

#note 4A QUARE(R) is a #visionSADDEST. I saw 4C QUA(R)ER but I was in such a defensive mindset I didn't think to hang anything in the triple line, especially after two 1 tile plays. I decided to put the S on this so she can't hook it and is forced to find eights.

#note I thought EWER didn't take an S. SAD! Although, even when EWERS is a word, I think this is still the best play.

#note Didn't know fricking EWERS. Feels like SADDEST but since it's only 5 points. #knowledgesad and also 1K VEG(A)S. I was completely out of time. #timeSADDEST
